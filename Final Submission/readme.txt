SOFTENG 206 Final Submission - GROUP 33

Included in the application folder is: this readme file, VARpedia_User_Manual.pdf, VARpedia_group33.jar, VARpedia_group33_runscript.sh. flickr-api-keys.txt, and a ‘music’ folder with 3 .mp3 files.

VARpedia is designed to run on the VirtualBox Linux Image.

You must provide a Flickr API key. Edit the flickr-api-keys.txt file to include your API key. Do not change the formatting of this file.

Upon execution, the application will create a ‘creations’ folder that will store your Creations and some test revision content. 
It will also create a hidden ‘.temp’ folder that is deleted when the program is closed. 
Do not edit either of these folders while the program is running. 
For optimal results, delete Creations through the application rather than by deleting the files.

To run the application:
1. 	Ensure that java version 13 is located at /usr/lib/jvm/jdk-13/bin/java
	Ensure that openjfx-13-rc+2_linux-x64_bin-sdk is in the Downloads folder

2.	Open the terminal

3. 	Ensure VARpedia_group33_runscript.sh, VARpedia_group33.jar, VARpedia_User_Manual.pdf, flickr-api-keys.txt, and the ‘music’ folder are in the current working directory

4. 	Type and run: chmod +x VARpedia_group33_runscript.sh

5. 	Finally, type and run: ./VARpedia_group33_runscript.sh
